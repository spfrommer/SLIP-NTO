This project numerically optimizes trajectories for a Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum over a mixture of slippery and sticky terrain. The SLIP model used features a damper, hip torque actuator, and radial actuator. Each simulation trial consists of a low-friction patch of ice surrounded by infinite-friction ground with the SLIP initialized to contact the ice patch.

MATLAB and the Optimization Toolbox are required, as well as the "Bound Values of an array" add-on.
