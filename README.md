This project numerically optimizes trajectories for a Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum over slippery terrain. The SLIP model used features a damper, hip torque actuator, and radial actuator. Each simulation trial consists of a low-friction patch of ice surrounded by infinite-friction ground.

MATLAB and the Optimization Toolbox are required.
